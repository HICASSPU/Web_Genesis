# Web Genesis: Day 8 - Authentication and Security

**Welcome back to Web Genesis!** Today we delve into the critical aspects of building secure and reliable backend applications: authentication and authorization.

**1. Authentication with Spring Security and JWT**

* **Authentication:** Understand the core concepts of authentication, the process of verifying a user's identity. 
* **Spring Security:** Learn how to integrate Spring Security into your Spring Boot application to handle user authentication. Spring Security is a powerful and flexible framework that provides a comprehensive set of features for securing your application.
* **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Explore JWT, a standard for creating secure and compact JSON-based tokens that represent user claims (e.g., username, roles, permissions). JWTs are a popular choice for authentication in modern applications due to their stateless nature and ease of use.
* **Implementing JWT Authentication:** 
    * **Generate and issue JWTs:**
        * After successful user login (e.g., username/password), generate a JWT containing user information (e.g., username, user ID, roles).
        * Include the JWT in the response (e.g., in the `Authorization` header) to the client.

    * **Example (Simplified):**

      ```java
      @RestController
      @RequestMapping("/api/auth")
      public class AuthController {

          @PostMapping("/login")
          public ResponseEntity<?> login(@RequestBody LoginRequest loginRequest) {
              // Authenticate user (e.g., check credentials against database) 
              // ...
              if (authenticationSuccessful) {
                  String jwt = jwtTokenProvider.generateToken(user); 
                  return ResponseEntity.ok(new AuthResponse(jwt)); 
              } else {
                  return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED).body("Invalid credentials");
              }
          }
      }
      ```

    * **Validate JWTs in subsequent requests:** 
        * In subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
        * Spring Security can be configured to intercept requests, extract the JWT from the header, and validate its authenticity and integrity.

    * **Example (Security Configuration):**

      ```java
      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

          @Autowired
          private JwtTokenProvider jwtTokenProvider; 

          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http
                  .httpBasic().disable() 
                  .csrf().disable() 
                  .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS) 
                  .and()
                  .authorizeRequests()
                      .antMatchers("/api/auth/login").permitAll() 
                      .anyRequest().authenticated() 
                  .and()
                  .exceptionHandling()
                      .authenticationEntryPoint(new JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint()) 
                  .and()
                  .apply(new JwtTokenFilterConfigurer(jwtTokenProvider)); 
          }
      }
      ```

**2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

* **Authorization:** Understand the concept of authorization, which determines what actions a user is allowed to perform within the application (e.g., which resources they can access, which operations they can execute).
* **Role-Based Access Control:** 
    * Learn how to implement RBAC, a common authorization model where users are assigned roles (e.g., "admin", "user", "guest") that determine their access privileges.
    * For example, an "admin" role might have full access to all resources, while a "user" role may have limited access.

* **Spring Security and RBAC:** 
    * Learn how to configure Spring Security to implement role-based access control.
    * Define roles and assign them to users within your application.
    * Secure endpoints by specifying the required roles for accessing those endpoints using the `@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured` annotations.

    * **Example:**

      ```java
      @RestController
      @RequestMapping("/api/data")
      public class DataController {

          @GetMapping("/admin")
          @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')") 
          public String getAdminData() {
              return "Admin data";
          }
      }
      ```

**3. Securing API Endpoints**

* **Common Security Vulnerabilities:** Learn about common security vulnerabilities in web applications, such as:
    * **SQL Injection:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into user input to manipulate the database.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Attackers trick users into performing unintended actions on a web application.

* **Securing API Endpoints:** 
    * Implement security measures to protect your API endpoints from common attacks:
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks.
        * **Proper Error Handling and Logging:** Handle and log errors gracefully to prevent sensitive information from being leaked.
        * **Use of Security Headers:** Implement security headers like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) and Content Security Policy (CSP) to enhance the security of your application.

**Mini-Project: Add User Authentication to Your Backend API**

Today's challenge: Enhance your existing backend API (from Day 6) with user authentication.

* **Features:**
    * Implement user registration and login functionality.
    * Issue JWTs to authenticated users.
    * Secure API endpoints with appropriate roles and permissions (e.g., only allow authenticated users to access certain endpoints).

* **Technical Requirements:**
    * Use Spring Security and JWT for authentication.
    * Implement RBAC to control user access to different API endpoints.
    * Test your authentication and authorization mechanisms thoroughly.
